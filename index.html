                        <p class="demo">Angelica refers to the dry roots of Angelica sinensis, an herb of Chinese traditional medicine. It has a widely curative effect in modern medicine. Because the internal chemistry components of Angelica sinensis are very complex and are lastly affected by different environmental factors and human factors during it growth cycle, it is difficult to control the plucking time and its dose effect. In my bachelor thesis, a systematic research on Angelica sinensis’ metabolomics was conducted at 27 samples in the different growth stages from Minxian, Gansu Province.</p>

The experimental results of H-NMR and GC-MS are shown in following figures. The statistical test, such as variance analysis and t-test, was implemented to distinguish the chemical characteristic peaks and chemical retention time of Angelica sinensis which varies greatly during the growth period. </p>

                        <p class="demo">In order to discover the dynamic accumulation of angelica metabolites and explore the metabolic components which are sensitive to the changes of years in its growth cycle, orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) is used to analyze the integral relative content in spectral data systematically. By comparing with database, the characteristic signal peaks of linoleic acid, Angelica polysaccharide, ligustilide, ferulic acid, Angelica lactone A, butenyl phthalide and 3-n-Butylphthalide were identified on the H-NMR fingerprint. According to the Universal Database of Gas Chromatographic Retention Index, furthermore, we identified about 44 volatile compounds from the volatile oil of Angelica sinensis. Identification results are shown in following figures.</p>

Therefore those compounds can be the symbolic chemical compositions used to evaluate the quality of angelica and control the harvest time; In the experimental process, we had found that the medicinal ingredients in angelica sinensis don’t reach the maximum content in the traditional harvest time, but the ratio between the Z-ligustilide and other ingredients, such as n-butylidenephthalide, reaches a reasonable level.</p>

                        <h3>1. Research Background</h3>
                        <p class="demo">Heterogeneous network is different from homogeneous network, which converts the network information extracted from the complex systems into the different types of nodes and links. At present, the majority of community detection methods are worked on homogeneous networks and such a hypothesis that the nodes and the links of a certain network structure are all the identical type is made. That hypothesis provides much convenience for the study on the community detection method. Compared with the community detection in homogeneous networks, the community detection based on heterogeneous networks can find out more association information and more accurate community structure. The research object of this paper is just based on the heterogeneous network which is constructed by using the academic paper data in the statistics research field.</p>

                        <h3>3. Research result</h3>
                        <p class="demo">Through the community detection methods, such as LDA topic model and label propagation algorithm, multi-dimensional structure, multimode information, semantic information and link connection in three dimensional networks will be extracted and utilized to seek out the community structures which are relatively close and have the practical significance. In the empirical analysis section, by using the method presented by this paper, multidimensional scientific research communities which have relatively compact structure, higher modularity and explicit practical significance are found out, including 4 journal communities, 20 paper communities under those 4 journal communities, and 92 author communities under those 20 paper communities.</p>
                        <p class="demo">The scientific research communities detected can provide science researchers with the journals, research achievements and research collaborators in the same field and can enable them to grasp the research direction and progress in future. Compared with traditional methods of homogeneous community detection, such as Louvain, the method proposed by the paper can make the most of heterogeneous information and node attribute information contained in the statistical science research network, find out the overlapping communities and cope with complex relationship of multi-dimensional structure well to improve the accuracy of algorithm. Moreover, such method can reduce the complexity of operation time for community detection with the parallel processing.</p>

The responses of 106 consumers to 32 questions about Samsung, Apple, HTC, Huawei and other four mobile phone brands were collected. Firstly, descriptive statistics is used to visualize the statistical characteristics of the four major mobile phone brands. Secondly, I construct a scientific evaluation model of satisfaction and loyalty through these mobile phone questionnaires, and then use Factor Analysis and Linear Regression to extract common factors that can reflect 22 evaluation indicators. By this way, we could reflect the four major mobile phone brands with a small number of common factors that can not be evaluated, such as performance-price ratio, user experience and symbolic performance. Then, I used these common factors to regress mobile phone manufacturers' satisfaction and loyalty and used regression model to analyze how the important factors affect loyalty and satisfaction. Finally, I put forward relevant suggestions for mobile phone companies to formulate correct production and marketing strategies. </p>

                        <p class="demo"> A data set without intercept( linear_random.csv) is generated by R. The data set contains 10 variables and 1 dependent variable and 10,000 records.</p> 
                        <p class="demo"> According to the principle of multiple regression, the formula for calculating regression coefficient can be divided into two parts——xy part and x'x part, and two parts can be calculated on Mapper. To be specific, firstly, xy calculation is done after line segmentation on each computational node (for example x11y, x12y,..., x110y) as the first column of data, and so on…… Now each node adds all the vectors. The calculation part of x'x is the same, except that x needs to be divided into 10 column vectors and the product part of X'is xy. After that, the two parts of each node's calculation result are merged into one line, and the flow is output to reducer. And then the sum is merged. Finally the matrix is restored to calculate deta.</p>

                        <p class="demo"> The crawler of Python was used to collect the lyric information of songs which have two opposite emotions (sad and happy) on the Internet music platform. Some lyrics in the sample were used to construct corpus and transformed into lyric vectors containing latent semantics by LSI and TF-idf model.</p>
                        <p class="demo"> Firstly, Lyric vectors with latent semantics was considered as input and the unknown-style songs were classified by the neural network built through Keras of python. Then, the music styles for large quantities of Lyric texts were classified by machine learning methods such as Naive Bayesian, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest in Mllib of Spark. The cross-validation accuracy of each model was more than 95%.</p>

                        <p class="demo">This project comprises 12 assignments in the class of Statistical Cases Studies. Ten of them are Individual assignment, one of them is a class presentation and the left one is a final project. I have had a basic grasp of processing flow and modeling method about NLP through several classes and those practices. More specifically, the skills I learned in this class are as following:</p>
                        <p class="demo"><b>Collection for Text Data: </b> Crawl data with python modules and frames, such as selenium，beautifulsoup，scrapy and so on.</p>                        
                        <p class="demo"><b>Preprocessing Method for Text Data:</b>  Regular expression and some python modules, such as re, nltk, jieba and so on.</p>
                        <p class="demo"><b>Model:</b>  Nonnegative Matrix Factor, Word2vector, N-gram, LDA and some methods derived from LDA.</p>    
                        <p class="demo"><b>Text2Vector Method: </b> tf-idf, doc2bow, doc2vec, lsi, etc.</p>                       
                        <p class="demo">The reports, code and figures of those cases are stored in this <a href="https://github.com/siyunb/applied-cases-in-NPL"><i>repository</i></a>.</p>
